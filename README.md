# Diabetes-prediction-analysis-among-women-in-India
Exploratory data analysis using SQL

This project was done using structured query language (SQL) for analysis and Excel for data visualization. Diabetes mellitus commonly refered to as diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces.
In this project, I performed exploratory analysis to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a woman (21 years and above) has diabetes and factors that make her susceptible to having diabetes.

PROJECT GOALS:

To ascertain the total number of diabetic and non-diabetic women.

What is the relationship between blood pressure and diabetes?

Does the number of times a woman gets pregnant affect her glucose level?

What is the correlation between body mass index and diabetes?

Does child bearing increase the risk of being diabetic?

What is the highest number of times a woman got pregnant and her glucose level?

DATA CLEANING:

The data was loaded into excel where empty rows were checked, and the find and replace tool used to rename the outcome column from binary value 0 and 1 to non-diabetic and diabetic respectively.

DATA ANALYSIS:

The data set was then imported into sequel (SQL) for analysis. 

DATA VISUALIZATION:
The data was visualized with Excel.

N/B: The sequel codes and dashboard can be found in the browse code.
